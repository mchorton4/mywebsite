          Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite
          sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this
          nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do
          because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state
          couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his
          right, he always rolled back to where he was.

            The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head
            and hands, and then work outward from there.

          He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't
          have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to
          feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before. "Oh, God",
          he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've chosen! Travelling
          day in and day out.

          Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own
          business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of travelling,
          worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact
          with different people all the time so that you can never get to know
          anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!
